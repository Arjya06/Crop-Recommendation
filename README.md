Crop Recommendation System 🌱
Overview
This project uses a machine learning model to recommend the best crop to grow based on soil and weather data. By analyzing factors such as fertilizer amount, temperature, and soil nutrient levels (N, P, K), the model predicts crop yield. The goal is to provide a data-driven tool to help farmers maximize their agricultural output.

The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, and the training and evaluation of two different regression models. The final model, a Random Forest Regressor, proved to be highly effective for this task.

Features 📋
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for modeling.

Model Training: Implements and trains both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models.

Model Evaluation: Compares the models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Data Visualization: Includes plots for actual vs. predicted values and highlights the most important features for predicting crop yield.

Results & Key Findings 📊
The Random Forest Regressor significantly outperformed the Linear Regression model, demonstrating its superior capability in handling the complexities of the dataset.

Model	MAE	RMSE
Random Forest Regressor	0.12	0.18
Linear Regression	0.57	0.69

Export to Sheets
The feature importance analysis revealed that Fertilizer and temperature (temp) are the most significant factors in determining crop yield.
